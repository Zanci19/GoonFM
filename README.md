# \# GoonFM

# 

# A lightweight, meme-forward landing page and player for your GoonFM radio stream. Paste your Icecast/SHOUTcast URL from \*\*butt\*\* and play live, or use the built-in fallback tone to verify audio before you go on-air.

# 

# \## Getting started

# 

# The site is fully static—open `index.html` in a browser or serve the folder locally:

# 

# ```bash

# npm run dev          # starts a simple HTTP server on port 4173

# \# or

# python -m http.server 4173

# ```

# 

# Then visit `http://localhost:4173` and drop in your live stream URL.

# 

# \## Features

# 

# \- Custom-styled HTML5 audio controls with play/pause, volume, and time display

# \- Stream URL input wired for Icecast/SHOUTcast endpoints from butt

# \- Fallback test tone (`assets/goon-tone.wav`) to verify audio without a stream

# \- Meme-inspired visuals with a reusable badge (`assets/goon-badge.svg`)
